      'Hooks are pretty new and hot topic in React world nowadays. The reason why this project has been created by me yesterday is to represent React hooks with <app-code-xs>useSelector</app-code-xs> and <app-code-xs>useDispatch</app-code-xs> usage in a functional component with simple Redux store. The app simulates a fake API call which on purpose returns sometimes with success or failed response.<br/><br/>The question why and how should I use these new hooks in a functional component with a Redux store is fairly frequently raised. Just like on Stack Overflow there was a confusion how to create a data table with a loading indicator with these hooks, find <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58780909/where-is-a-good-to-call-actions-for-fail-and-success-in-react-redux/58781346#58781346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my answer here</a>.<br/><br/>I guess it is much better to have a code example for explanation in this scenario. The above mentioned two hooks are the replication in functional components for <app-code-xs>mapStateToProps</app-code-xs> and <app-code-xs>mapDispatchToProps</app-code-xs> from class based components.<br/><br/>Follow the link to see the working example in my <a href="https://github.com/norbitrial/react-redux-loading-data-example" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> repository.',
